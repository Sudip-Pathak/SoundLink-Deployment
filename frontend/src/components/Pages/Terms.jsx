            <p>
              Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or SoundLink cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting SoundLink customer support team.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide SoundLink with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize SoundLink to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, SoundLink will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by SoundLink until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.
